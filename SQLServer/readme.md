Weâ€™re excited to introduce SQLServer Exporter, a simple tool to help exporting your SQLServer Code
so it can be migrated to Snowflake.

## Version

Version 1.1 
Release 2021-09-07

## Usage

The `extract-sql-server-ddl.ps1` script attempts to connect to an instance of SQL Server using either Windows or SQL authentication and, for each database that survives inclusion/exclusion filters, retrieves certain object definitions as individual DDL files to a local directory.

The script use the following parameters:

* **ServerName**: Specifies the SQL Server instance to use
* **Port**: Specifies the port to use (default is 1433)
* **SqlAuthentication**: Bypass "normal" Windows Authentication when attempting to connect (default is false)
* **UserId**: Specifies the user name to use when attempting to connect (used in conjunction with -SqlAuthentication)
* **Password**: Specifies the password associated with the UserId to use when attempting to connect (used in conjunction with -SqlAuthentication)
* **IncludeSystemObjects**: Specify whether to include databases, schemas, and tables tagged as SQL Server system objects (default is false)
* **IncludeDatabases**: Specifies databases that match the listed pattern(s) be included in the extraction (default is all)
* **ExcludeDatabases**: Specifies databases that match the listed pattern(s) be excluded from the extraction (default is none)
* **ScriptDirectory**: Specifies the root directory in which the extracted files are to be stored (default is C:\MyScriptsDirectory)
* **INPUTS**: None.  You cannot pipe objects to extract-sql-server-ddl.ps1.
* **OUTPUTS**: System.String.

Here some examples of how use the script:

Example 1:

```ps
PS> .\extract-sql-server-ddl.ps1
